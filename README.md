# My VCSH
## What is it
This is my general vcsh configuration repository.
Initially it will have all of my versioned configuration, but I may at some point end up splitting some files into other repositories.

## My environment
For reference, most of this is geared towards the Mac I use for software development. I install homebrew on my personal machine and use that as a package manager. Different branches may represent my config on different machines that I use, where I may not have privledges or permission to install certain software.
